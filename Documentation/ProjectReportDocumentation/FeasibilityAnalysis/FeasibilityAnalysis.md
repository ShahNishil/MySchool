### 1.	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Data, Statistics and Feedback are very crucial components to improvement. Our educators are deprived of such important tools that help them gather these components. They have almost no feedback system. Data and statistics about the performances of students under them or about them are not systematically available. Educators hold one of the world most important jobs and face one of the world toughest challenges. 

To triumph over such challenges, Student Analysis and Feedback System (SAAFS) introduce the power of Data Science to address variance in teaching, to help learn better and improve classroom practice. SAAFS is an online tool accessible anytime, just an authentication away, providing the teachers and learners a detailed custom portal to analyze and predict content understood by the active learner and learning. Day by day technology is being embedded into education systems and so such a platform will stand and make a huge difference in closing gap in student learning.

### 2.	DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
SAAFS will custom a dashboard that provides a brief data analysis on overall student’s grade responsible to the educator and a prediction based on the current trends and feedback. A brief visual representation based on feedback and survey detailing the educator performance and effectiveness. This helps to point specific flaws of the learner and educator. Helps decrease the variance in teaching.

The learner will be facilitated with a feedback form on a daily basis. Learner will get a report on the data collected and shown flaws and great achievements to self improve.

### 3.	TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS
A demand for simple and easy interactive portal is required. It has to be secured. Providing the portal on web makes it easy to access and helps in initial push to implement the system. Also a lot of educators might refrain to use it as they might not be comfortable using tech. To solve that the service can be accessed easily by just an authentication and the summary reports are specially designed into graphs that are easily understood.

 On the web helps the system to be deployed cross platform and be independent. Also the data collect is beneficiary for the Machine Learning service to provide more accurate and precise result.


 

### 4.	ORGANIZATION AND STAFFING
Staffing Position #1: Online Helpdesk – this full time position will guide school staff in identifying efficiently using SAAFS. Help the educators and students to correctly identify and work with the system. A Helpdesk will provide help troubleshooting SAAFS.


### 5.	FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
